  "aboutusPageSubtitle": "Our Workshops",
  "aboutusPageWorkshopText": "Above all, it’s an energetic afternoon where participants learn new choreographies to mainly Afro sounds. Guided by their coach, they are taken step-by-step through every movement with passion and energy.\n\nThe session is divided into three main parts: warm-up, a trending mini-choreography (often inspired by viral TikTok dances), and a main choreography prepared by the coach. We invite all participants to come motivated, on time, and ready to have fun on the dance floor!\n\nAfrodance Corner is also a place of exchange, meeting, and sharing among dance enthusiasts in a friendly and vibrant atmosphere.",
